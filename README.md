# Festival website
Responsive website with dynamic components. The positioning of certain elements were made with flexbox. The navigation bar is responsive and vertically collapses on mobile view, and remains horizontal on tablet and desktop view. Both versions have a function that enables smooth scroll on the webpage when clicking on the links within the navbar. The headline slowly fades out when scrolling down the page.
